# Tasks
I'll analyze potential improvements, focusing on performance-critical areas and artificial bottlenecks.

### Performance Analysis and Recommendations

1. [DONE] **Frame Processing Bottlenecks**
   - **Current Issue**: The main loop processes every frame at 30 FPS regardless of system capability
   - **Impact**: High-end devices could potentially run at 60 FPS
   - **Recommendation**: 
     - Implement adaptive frame rate based on device performance
     - Add frame timing to measure actual processing time
     - Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` timing instead of fixed 30ms intervals

2. [TODO] **Canvas and Video Processing**
   - **Current Issue**: Every frame copies the entire video to canvas and processes it
   - **Impact**: High memory bandwidth usage and unnecessary processing
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Implement frame skipping when processing can't keep up
     - Consider using WebGL textures directly from video instead of canvas
     - Add resolution scaling for lower-end devices
     - Implement frame buffering to prevent processing backlog

3. [TODO] **AR.js GPS Updates**
   - **Current Issue**: GPS updates trigger object placement and coordinate calculations
   - **Impact**: Frequent GPS updates could cause jitter
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Implement GPS update throttling
     - Add position smoothing/interpolation
     - Cache GPS coordinates and only update when change is significant
     - Consider using relative positioning from last known good position

4. [TODO] **Coordinate System Transformations**
   - **Current Issue**: Frequent coordinate system conversions between AlvaAR and Three.js
   - **Impact**: Computational overhead in main loop
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Cache transformation matrices where possible
     - Batch coordinate transformations
     - Consider using shared coordinate systems where possible
     - Implement transformation matrix pooling

5. [TODO] **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - **Current Issue**: Basic error handling with alerts
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience during errors
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Implement graceful degradation
     - Add automatic recovery mechanisms
     - Provide visual feedback for tracking quality
     - Add fallback modes for poor GPS/visual tracking

6. [TODO] **Device Capability Detection**
   - **Current Issue**: Fixed configuration regardless of device
   - **Impact**: Suboptimal performance on different devices
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Add device capability detection
     - Implement quality settings based on device performance
     - Add fallback rendering modes
     - Consider WebGL feature detection

7. [TODO] **Debug Visualization**
   - **Current Issue**: Feature point visualization runs continuously when tracking is lost
   - **Impact**: Unnecessary rendering overhead
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Make debug visualization toggleable
     - Implement debug mode with performance metrics
     - Add selective feature point rendering
     - Consider using WebGL for debug visualization

8. [TODO] **Initialization Process**
    - **Current Issue**: Sequential initialization of components
    - **Impact**: Longer startup time
    - **Recommendations**:
      - Parallelize initialization where possible
      - Implement progressive loading
      - Add loading indicators
      - Consider lazy loading of non-critical components
